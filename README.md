# HomeAssistantConfig

Yet another Home Assistant Config (YAHAC :-P ) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/D43m0n/HomeAssistantConfig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/D43m0n/HomeAssistantConfig)

Feel free to use. I apply changes to my Home Assistant configuration before I push them to the repository. That triggers a Travis job to verify the configuration, so there's some form of checking going on.
